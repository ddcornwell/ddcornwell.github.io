	<article><h2>All about me.</h2>
		<p>Hi there, My name is Matt Thomson, I'm a lifelong Texas surfer living in Austin now. I also run a surf vacation rental business called Wavecation. Like many of you, I spent years near the ocean surfing every day (Malibu and Maui mostly) but now find myself landlocked with a family and not much time to take surf trips.</p> 

		<p id="first-p">In 2013 I attended the Surf Park Summit in California and then started this Facebook page to encourage and support any efforts to build a park in TEXAS.</p>

		<p>About a year later NLand Surf Park, headed by Doug Coors began construction on a surf park just east of Austin's airport. I post any updates on that park that I can (though I am not affiliated with them) and any other interesting surf park news.</p>

		<p>Every Texas surfer has dreamed of surfing clean, consistent and fun waves on a regular basis. We may finally be able to do that soon even without living on the coast or making a multi-hour drive on a regular basis.</p>

		<p><strong>Benefits of Surf parks:</strong>
		Provide recreation for surfer
		Surf school and lessons in controlled environment
		Opportunities to study wave energy
		More environmentally friendly than driving 50+ miles to the surf break
		Innovative job creators
		Teach water safety and strong swimming skills
		Great group outings
		Day camps for kids
		Rehab opportunities for physical therapy
		So much more...
